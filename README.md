# 1. Environment Setup

## 1.1 ROS2 Setup

 I use the ROS2 Humble distributions, which is the recommended for the latest ROS2 LTS at the time this note is being written (2023.4). I installed ros2 on Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.04), and used the recommended way which is to install the debian packages. The main steps are from the link: [Ubuntu (Debian) &mdash; ROS 2 Documentation: Humble documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html). I also list the steps I did as below:

### 1.1.1 Set locale

The recommended steps are:

```
locale  # check for UTF-8
sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
locale  # verify settings
```

The command ‘locale’ at my ubuntu 22.04 shows “LANG=en_CA.UTF-8”, which is already UTF-8. Therefore, I didn’t follow the above steps to reconfigure the locale again.

### 1.1.2 Setup Sources

The official steps are:

```
# enable ubuntu universe repository
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe


#add the ROS2 GPG key with apt
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg


# add the repository to my sources list
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

Normally there should not be an issue for this stage. However, the access to the hostname “raw.githubusercontent.com” is quite unstable at my side. Then I download the file “ros.key” and create the “/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg” manually based on the content of file “ros.key”.



### **1.1.3 Install ROS 2 packages**

The official steps are:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade


# Desktop Install (Recommended): ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials.
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop


# ROS-Base Install (Bare Bones): Communication libraries, message packages, command line tools. No GUI tools.
sudo apt install ros-humble-ros-base


# Development tools: compilers and other tools to build ROS
sudo apt install ros-dev-tools

```

For me, I run the first three “apt install” commands, as I need the GUI feature. This step will cost several minutes depending on the network speed.



### **1.1.4 Try simple examples**

If everything goes well, now we should have ROS2 humble set up. Now we can run simple examples to verify this. First, we open two terminals, and run below for each terminal:

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
```

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
```

Now we can see the talker publishing “Hello World” message with index, and the listener printing “I heard” messages.

Note: I verified that the above steps for ROS2 humble installation also apply to Windows WSL 2 for Ubuntu 22.04.



## 1.2 MoveIt 2 Setup

MoveIt 2 is the robotic manipulation platform for ROS 2, and includes various motion planning, manipulation, perception and navigation algorithms. The official recommended ROS 2 distribution version is ROS 2 Humble. The official steps to install MoveIt 2 are as below:

### 1.2.1 Install ROS 2

We assume that ROS 2 Humble has already been installed, so we only need to apply the environment variables:

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

### 1.2.2 Install Colcon and Rosdep

Colcon is used to compile the source code, and rosdep is used to check the dependency and install them automatically. The recommended steps to install rosdep are:

```
sudo apt install python3-rosdep
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade
```

For colcon, colcon-mixin is recommended instead of colcon as it provided nice interface for different compilation configuration. However, as I’ll indicate later, due to the network access issue, neigher rosdep or colcon-mixin can be used at my side, so I use colcon by assigning the compiler configuration manually and ignore the rosdep by fixing the compiling dependency issue manually. The official steps to install colcon-mixin are as below:

```
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
sudo apt install python3-colcon-mixin
colcon mixin add default https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository/master/index.yaml
colcon mixin update default
sudo apt install python3-vcstool
```

If can execute above commands successfully, I recommend to follow the official steps to avoid debugging the compiling issues.



### 1.2.3 Download MoveIt 2 source code

In this step, I first create a folder as colcon workspace, and then download the source code of MoveIt 2 and tutorials into this folder.

```
mkdir -p moveit2_ws/src
cd moveit2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2_tutorials -b humble --depth 1
vcs import < moveit2_tutorials/moveit2_tutorials.repos
```

The “vcs import” in last step may not work stable sometimes, you can just ctrl-c and then re-run it.



### 1.2.4 Compile the source code

To compile the source code, the official steps are first check and fix the dependencies by using rosdep, and then use colcon --mixin to compile. The commands are:

```
sudo apt update && rosdep install -r --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO -y
cd moveit2_ws
colcon build --mixin release
```

As what I mentioned, rosdep and colcon --mixin can not work at my side due to the network access issue. Therefore, I skip the dependencies check step, and use below commands to compile the code:

```
sudo apt install ros-humble-graph-msgs ros-humble-rviz-visual-tools freeglut3-dev
colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --parallel-workers 4
```

The packages I installed are based on the compilation error I met during the compilation at my side, one may have different errors and need to install different missed packages based on the environment. For the “colcon build”, I replace the “--mixin release” with “--cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release” to indicate the build type manually. For “--parallel-workers 4”, this is to limit the maximum parallelling workers, the colcon tool will consume as many resources to do the compiling and the shell process would crash frequently if I don’t limit the max number of workers.

If everything goes well, we can see all the packages can be compiled, see the log at my side below:

```

Note: please ignore the time showed in above log, it is quite fast as I just re-run the command again on the project which is already fully compiled, so it only print out messages without actual compiling.



### 1.2.5 Setup the workspace

Now we can source the bash script to apply the environment variables of MoveIt 2:

```
source moveit2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

According to the official website, as of Sep 26, 2022, the default ROS 2 middleware (RMW) implementation has an issue. As a workaround, switch to Cyclone DDS. (Note: this makes all nodes started using this RMW incompatible with any other nodes not using Cyclone DDS.)

```
sudo apt install ros-humble-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp
# You may want to add this to ~/.bashrc to source it automatically
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
```

I didn’t try the default ROS 2 RMW, and followed the exactly the above commands to use the cyclone DDS. 

[Note:] Need to disable the last line to make RViz work normally.



# 2. Simulators and Demo

## 2.1 ROS2 Tutorials

Once the ROS2 is installed successfully. The first thing I did was go through the ROS2 tutorials. The main official link for the ROS2 tutorial is: [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683129835307756&usg=AOvVaw3Jrz-aX-tPesJvZq7OxbrL). We can see from the link that there are different levels of tutorials, which are beginner, intermediate and advanced. For me, I mainly go through the two beginner sessions, see below:

<img title="" src="file:///home/hao/Workspace/COMP8604/comp8604/images/2.1.png" alt=":" width="297" data-align="inline">       <img title="" src="file:///home/hao/Workspace/COMP8604/comp8604/images/2.1_1.png" alt="fw" width="310" data-align="inline">

I think these two sessions are necessary for beginners to have an understanding of basic ROS2 concepts, like the nodes, topics, services, parameters and actions. In the second beginner session, we can have some hand-on coding experience to understand the ROS2 api to implement publisher and subscriber, service and client, and custom interfaces. In the meeting with Rahul in the upcoming week, he told me that having basic knowledge of ROS2 is enough, I should put more effort into how the motion planning algorithm is integrated into the demo. ROS2 is mainly a platform to provide various services.

For ROS2 runtime environment configuration, I run below commands to save them into my bash boot script so that I don’t need to set up the configuration every time I open a new shell.

```
echo “source /opt/ros/humble/setup.sh” >> ~/.bashrc
echo “export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1” >> ~/.bashrc
echo “export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=21” >> ~/.bashrc
```

The “ROS_DOMAIN_ID” is a unique integer I selected for all my ROS2 nodes so that they can communicate with each other from different shells. I also apply “ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY” to limit the communication locally for now as I don’t need to communicate with nodes on other computers through the network currently.



## 2.2 Turtlebot3 Simulating

The first demo I intended to try was this turtlebot3 simulation demo, which is included as external resources in the ROS2 demo website: [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Demos.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Demos.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683129835309577&usg=AOvVaw2hLtrV39v4g8tG0RgQpn-e). There are several useful links for turtlebot3:

1. Quick start guide: [TurtleBot3](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/)

2. Simulate the TurtleBot3: [https://ubuntu.com/blog/simulate-the-turtlebot3](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ubuntu.com/blog/simulate-the-turtlebot3&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683129835310572&usg=AOvVaw0T0bkqfGq13ShTk3vKmyu0)

3. Navigating in simulation:[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/Navigate-TurtleBot3](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/Navigate-TurtleBot3&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683129835310973&usg=AOvVaw2V-Bbs-PzdBpftJoxC6ud5)

4. Learning SLAM in simulation:[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/SLAM-with-TurtleBot3](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/SLAM-with-TurtleBot3&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683129835311413&usg=AOvVaw1vuSBUlxM-na-1R8rs3c3K)

However, the latest turtlebot3 doesn’t support ROS2 humble according to its official website at the time this document is drafted(2023.4), and the latest ROS2 version is Foxy. As I only have Ubuntu 22.04 installed on my PC, I tried two methods to try to enable turtlebot3 simulation, which are illustrated in the two sections below.



### 2.2.1 Run on Windows WSL2 for Ubuntu 20.04.

This is the first method I tried, as it is quite convenient to install different Ubuntu distribution versions for Windows WSL2. I mainly refer to the above “link 2: Simulate the TurtleBot3”, which is based on ROS2 foxy.

The **first** step is to install ROS2 Foxy, it is pretty much the same as the Section 1.1 except run below command to install ros2 foxy:

```
sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
```

The **second** step is to install the Gazebo simulator. Actually turtlebot3 supports both Gazebo simulator and visualization tool RViz. I just follow the link to install Gazebo by using below command:

```
sudo apt install gazebo11 ros-foxy-gazebo-ros-pkgs
```

The **third*** step is install turtlebot3, the steps in the link are as below:

```
sudo apt install python3-vcstool
mkdir -p ~/turtlebot3_ws/src
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3/ros2/turtlebot3.repos
vcs import src < turtlebot3.repos
```

However, as the access to “raw.githubusercontent.com” is unstable at my side, I download the turtlebot3.repos and then use git to clone the repositories and branches indicated in this file. Then I use “colcon build –symlink-install” to compile the turtlebot3 source code. There are several errors during compilation but I didn’t record it, it seems they are related to some missed packages. I will try to record this in future practice. The completion log is as below:

```
hao@ANU:/mnt/h/COMP8604/ROS/workspaces_foxy/turtlebot3_ws$ colcon build --symlink-install

Finished <<< turtlebot3 [8.69s]

Summary: 17 packages finished [1min 30s]
hao@ANU:/mnt/h/COMP8604/ROS/workspaces_foxy/turtlebot3_ws$
```

After the compilation is done, run below to set up the environment of turtlebot3:

```
echo 'source /mnt/h/COMP8604/ROS/workspaces_foxy/turtlebot3_ws/install/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:/mnt/h/COMP8604/ROS/workspaces_foxy/turtlebot3_ws/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/models' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

The **final*** step is to launch the simulator by using below command:

```
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo empty_world.launch.py
```

However, seems the gzserver meet segment fault, and the process is died. Therefore, I can’t launch the simulator successfully. See below error log:

```

```

I think this may be related to the limited support of Gazebo on Windows WSL2, but I don’t have another Ubuntu 20.04 for testing. Currently, I leave it here until I need to debug it on WSL2.



### 2.2.2 Run on Ubuntu 22.04 ROS2 humble.

The main reason to try turtlebot3 on ROS2 humble is I already have a workable ROS2 humble and Ubuntu 22.04 PC ready. Besides, I see from the turtlebot3 github source that most of required package already have humble-devel branch, and also marked as “passing”, see below picture which is from github link: [https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3/tree/humble-devel](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3/tree/humble-devel&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683129835321774&usg=AOvVaw24cRdp3hp7_eE89QKpHlCO).

![dd](/home/hao/Workspace/COMP8604/comp8604/images/2.2.2.png)

Basically I follow the similar procedure as the last section, except I use below commands to install the gazebo package for humble instead of foxy.

```
sudo apt install gazebo libgazebo-dev ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs
```

For turtlebot3 repositories indicated by file “turtlebot3.repos”, I changed the git branch from “foxy-devel” to “humble-devel” for all the turtlebot3 repositories I compiled.

The compilation log is attached as below, there are several warnings. We can also see that the the compilation on my Ubuntu PC is a lot faster than Windows WSL2 (given the cpu for Windows is superior than my Ubuntu PC).

   It turns out that by doing the steps in this section, I manage to run the turtlebot3 simulator successfully based on ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04.
   
   Note: I also tried to run another turtlebot3_house.launch.py, but it seems the gazebo freezed. There are no error messages printed out on the console, but I notice there is below message:
   
   ```
   [gzclient-2] ../src/intel/isl/isl.c:2216: FINISHME: ../src/intel/isl/isl.c:isl_surf_supports_ccs: CCS for 3D textures is disabled, but a workaround is available.
   ```
   
   This message also occurs in the above two experiments. I guess the gazebo freezes because it performs rendering by using CPU instead of utilizing the cuda GPU driver and rendering on my Nvidia GPU card. May need more debugging in future if I plan to fix this.
   
   

## 2.3 MoveIt2 Planning Around Object Demo

This is a demo which shows how to perform simple planning which has an obstacle object in the scene. To set up the scene, we first set the target pose and then create a collision object which is between the robot arm and the target pose. Then we call the planning interface of Moveit2 to do the planning and execute the trajectory if the planning is successful.

First let’s look at the below three pictures for: a) initial state, b) planning, c) executing. We can see that the whole process is visualized, the robot arm moves to the target along the planned trajectory to avoid the collision object.

   ![dd](/home/hao/Workspace/COMP8604/comp8604/images/2.3_2.png)   ![dd](/home/hao/Workspace/COMP8604/comp8604/images/2.3_3.png)  

![dd](/home/hao/Workspace/COMP8604/comp8604/images/2.3_1.png)

For the details of this tutorial, it can be found from: [planning around objects](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://moveit.picknik.ai/humble/doc/tutorials/planning_around_objects/planning_around_objects.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683129835335930&usg=AOvVaw3GVvkjMH0Xt6Dymc9fHryH). Basically we need to follow below major steps:

1. Use “MoveGroupInterface” class to perform the planning:
   
   We can see from below code that a MoveGroupInterface object is instantiated as “move_group_interface”.
   
   ```
   using moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroupInterface;
   auto move_group_interface = MoveGroupInterface(node, "panda_arm");
   ```

2. Create the target pose and then call MoveGroupInterface function to set the target:
   
   ```
   auto const target_pose = []{
     geometry_msgs::msg::Pose msg;
     msg.orientation.w = 1.0;
     msg.position.x = 0.28;
     msg.position.y = 0.4;
     msg.position.z = 0.5;
     return msg;
   }()
   move_group_interface.setPoseTarget(target_pose);
   ```

3. The collision object is created by “CollisionOjbect” and managed by “PlanningSceneInterface”:
   
   ```
   // Create collision object for the robot to avoid
   auto const collision_object = [frame_id = move_group_interface.getPlanningFrame()] {
     moveit_msgs::msg::CollisionObject collision_object;
     collision_object.header.frame_id = frame_id;
     collision_object.id = "box1";
     shape_msgs::msg::SolidPrimitive primitive;
   
     // Define the size of the box in meters
     primitive.type = primitive.BOX;
     primitive.dimensions.resize(3);
     primitive.dimensions[primitive.BOX_X] = 0.5;
     primitive.dimensions[primitive.BOX_Y] = 0.1;
     primitive.dimensions[primitive.BOX_Z] = 0.5;
   
     // Define the pose of the box (relative to the frame_id)
     geometry_msgs::msg::Pose box_pose;
     box_pose.orientation.w = 1.0;
     box_pose.position.x = 0.2;
     box_pose.position.y = 0.2;
     box_pose.position.z = 0.25;
   
     collision_object.primitives.push_back(primitive);
     collision_object.primitive_poses.push_back(box_pose);
     collision_object.operation = collision_object.ADD;
   
     return collision_object;
   }();
   
   // Add the collision object to the scene
   moveit::planning_interface::PlanningSceneInterface planning_scene_interface;
   planning_scene_interface.applyCollisionObject(collision_object);
   ```

4. Call the method “plan” and “execute” of class “MoveGroupInterface” to perform the planning and execute the planned trajectory:
   
   ```
   // Create a plan to that target pose
   auto const [success, plan] = [&move_group_interface]{
     moveit::planning_interface::MoveGroupInterface::Plan msg;
     auto const ok = static_cast<bool>(move_group_interface.plan(msg));
     return std::make_pair(ok, msg);
   }();
   
   // Execute the plan
   if(success) {
     move_group_interface.execute(plan);
   } else {
     RCLCPP_ERROR(logger, "Planing failed!");
   }
   ```
   
   Note: The “plan” and “execute” here are actually implemented as an ROS2 action client, and we need to run the corresponding action server first so that the action requests can be appropriately handled by the server. In this demo, the server node is implemented by node “move_group” and we use below command to run the server and other services:
   
   ```
   ros2 launch moveit2_tutorials demo.launch.py
   ```
   
   The launch file can be found in the source code of Moveit2.



## 2.4 MoveIt2 Pick-and-Place Demo

I’ll leave this part for later, as it includes a combination of various different problems.



# 3. Source Code Deep Dive

## 3.1 “RobotModel” and “RobotState” class

The [RobotModel](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/blob/main/moveit_core/robot_model/include/moveit/robot_model/robot_model.h&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683129835343626&usg=AOvVaw2O01LkDZ7wnor76CvLpHgM) class contains the relationships between all links and joints including their joint limit properties as loaded from the URDF. The [RobotState](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/blob/main/moveit_core/robot_state/include/moveit/robot_state/robot_state.h&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683129835343943&usg=AOvVaw3v2x-6u7Hfw7J2wnREiTxb) contains information about the robot at a certain point in time, storing vectors of joint positions and optionally velocities and accelerations.

Before creating the “RobotModel” class, we first instantiate a [RobotModelLoader](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/blob/main/moveit_ros/planning/robot_model_loader/include/moveit/robot_model_loader/robot_model_loader.h&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683129835344310&usg=AOvVaw2G_WPTk0zKJirO4ypQPL6G) object which uses the ROS2 node as input parameter. Then we use the loader object to acquire the RobotModel object.

```
robot_model_loader::RobotModelLoader robot_model_loader(node);
const moveit::core::RobotModelPtr& model = robot_model_loader.getModel();
```

Then, we can use the “model” object to construct the RobotState object:

```
moveit::core::RobotStatePtr kinematic_state(new moveit::core::RobotState(model));
kinematic_state->setToDefaultValues();
```

### 3.1.1 Joint Groups

We can acquire the joint groups from the RobotModel object and get the values of each joint from the RobotState object:

```
const moveit::core::JointModelGroup* joint_model_group = model->getJointModelGroup("panda_arm");
const std::vector<std::string>& joint_names = joint_model_group->getVariableNames();
std::vector<double> joint_values;

//acquire the joint values
kinematic_state->copyJointGroupPositions(joint_model_group, joint_values);

//print the joint values
for (std::size_t i = 0; i < joint_names.size(); ++i) {
  RCLCPP_INFO(LOGGER, "Joint %s: %f", joint_names[i].c_str(), joint_values[i]);
}
```

If we want to apply the joint limits, we can call the function from RobotState object:

```
/* Enforce the joint limits for this state and check again*/
kinematic_state->enforceBounds();
```

### 3.1.2 Kinematics

We can compute the forward kinematics by using the method “getGlobalLinkTransform” from RobotState class. Below code compute the forward kinematics for a set of random joint values:

```
kinematic_state->setToRandomPositions(joint_model_group);
const Eigen::Isometry3d& end_effector_state = kinematic_state->getGlobalLinkTransform("panda_link8");

/* Print end-effector pose. Remember that this is in the model frame */
RCLCPP_INFO_STREAM(LOGGER, "Translation: \n" << end_effector_state.translation() << "\n");
RCLCPP_INFO_STREAM(LOGGER, "Rotation: \n" << end_effector_state.rotation() << "\n");
```

We can also solve the inverse kinematics by using the method “setFromIK” from RobotState class. Here the input parameter is the desired pose of end-effector. See below example code for the usage:

```
double timeout = 0.1;
bool found_ik = kinematic_state->setFromIK(joint_model_group, end_effector_state, timeout);
if (found_ik) {
  kinematic_state->copyJointGroupPositions(joint_model_group, joint_values);
  for (std::size_t i = 0; i < joint_names.size(); ++i) {
    RCLCPP_INFO(LOGGER, "Joint %s: %f", joint_names[i].c_str(), joint_values[i]);
  }
} Else {
  RCLCPP_INFO(LOGGER, "Did not find IK solution");
}
```

We can also get the Jacobian by using the method “getJacobian“ from RobotState class, see below:

```
Eigen::Vector3d reference_point_position(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
Eigen::MatrixXd jacobian;
kinematic_state->getJacobian(joint_model_group,
                             kinematic_state->getLinkModel(joint_model_group->getLinkModelNames().back()),
                             reference_point_position, jacobian);
RCLCPP_INFO_STREAM(LOGGER, "Jacobian: \n" << jacobian << "\n");
```

### 3.1.3 CS223A Online Resource

For the first time to learn the concept of kinematics, there is a good online resource [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS223A&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683129835355334&usg=AOvVaw29hOsJn9Hv9XbopNvZ0fnN), which is the course “CS223A - Introduction to Robotics” from Stanford University. The course is a bit old, which is from 2009. However, the video lectures are available for outside access and the lecture contents are presented quite clearly with high quality. Besides, I think the basic concept still applies today. There are total 16 videos (total length around 18 hours), and the syllabus is as below:

```
1/9 W Introduction (read handout)
1/14 M Spatial descriptions 1 (read LN:ch1 )
1/16 W Spatial descriptions 2 (read LN:ch1 )
1/23 W Forward Kinematics 1 (read LN:ch2 )
1/28 M Forward Kinematics 2 (read LN:ch2 )
1/30 W Jacobians: Velocities (read LN:ch4 )
2/04 M Jacobians: Explicit Form (read LN:ch4 )
2/06 W Jacobians: Static Forces (read LN:ch4 )
2/11 M Vision in Robotics (Guest Lecturer)
2/20 W Inverse Kinematics/Trajectory generation (read LN:ch3,ch6 )
2/25 M Dynamics: Acceleration and Inertia (read LN:ch5 )

```

I spent several days finishing the first 5 lectures last week, and plan to finish the whole lectures in the next two weeks using my spare time.



## 3.2 Motion Planning API

In MoveIt2, motion planners are used as the plugin. Such design allows the flexible use of different motion planners. To indicate which motion planner you would like to use, we can add in the launch file below statements:

```
def generate_launch_description():
    ...
    planning_plugin = {"planning_plugin": "ompl_interface/OMPLPlanner"}
    return LaunchDescription(
        [
            Node(
                package="moveit2_tutorials",
                executable="motion_planning_api_tutorial",
                name="motion_planning_api_tutorial",
                parameters=[
                    robot_description,
                        ...
                    planning_plugin,
                ],
            )
        ]
    )
```

Then we can use the “get_parameter” method to acquire the parameter from the server. Once we get the plugin name, we can use the “pluginlib::ClassLoader” to load an instance of specific planner.

```
  // We will now construct a loader to load a planner, by name.
  // Note that we are using the ROS pluginlib library here.
  std::unique_ptr<pluginlib::ClassLoader<planning_interface::PlannerManager>> planner_plugin_loader;
  planning_interface::PlannerManagerPtr planner_instance;
  std::string planner_plugin_name;

  // We will get the name of planning plugin we want to load
  // from the ROS parameter server, and then load the planner
  // making sure to catch all exceptions.
  if (!motion_planning_api_tutorial_node->get_parameter("planning_plugin", planner_plugin_name))
    RCLCPP_FATAL(LOGGER, "Could not find planner plugin name");

  try
  {
    planner_plugin_loader.reset(new pluginlib::ClassLoader<planning_interface::PlannerManager>(
        "moveit_core", "planning_interface::PlannerManager"));
  }
  catch (pluginlib::PluginlibException& ex)
  {
    RCLCPP_FATAL(LOGGER, "Exception while creating planning plugin loader %s", ex.what());
  }
  try
  {
    planner_instance.reset(planner_plugin_loader->createUnmanagedInstance(planner_plugin_name));
    if (!planner_instance->initialize(robot_model, motion_planning_api_tutorial_node, motion_planning_api_tutorial_node->get_namespace()))
      RCLCPP_FATAL(LOGGER, "Could not initialize planner instance");
    RCLCPP_INFO(LOGGER, "Using planning interface '%s'", planner_instance->getDescription().c_str());
  }
```

We can see that “planner_instance” is a pointer which points to “PlannerManager”. The instance of “PlannerManager” is created by the “createUnmanagedInstance” method. Once we have this instance of “PlannerManager” we can call the corresponding planner algorithms to perform the motion planning. After diving into the OMPL implementation of “PlannerManager”, I think the “PlannerManager” is only a wrapper class. The detailed implementation is done by the “PlanningContext” class.



We can see from below snippets from file “moveit2/moveit_planners/ompl/ompl_interface/src/ ompl_planner_manager.cpp”:

```
class OMPLPlannerManager : public planning_interface::PlannerManager
{
public:
  OMPLPlannerManager() : planning_interface::PlannerManager()
  {
     ...
  }

  bool initialize(const moveit::core::RobotModelConstPtr& model, const rclcpp::Node::SharedPtr& node,
                  const std::string& parameter_namespace) override
  {
    ompl_interface_ = std::make_unique<OMPLInterface>(model, node, parameter_namespace);
    setPlannerConfigurations(ompl_interface_->getPlannerConfigurations());
    return true;
  }

  bool canServiceRequest(const moveit_msgs::msg::MotionPlanRequest& req) const override
  {
    return req.trajectory_constraints.constraints.empty();
  }

  std::string getDescription() const override
  {
    return "OMPL";
  }

  void getPlanningAlgorithms(std::vector<std::string>& algs) const override
  {
    const planning_interface::PlannerConfigurationMap& pconfig = ompl_interface_->getPlannerConfigurations();
    algs.clear();
    algs.reserve(pconfig.size());
    for (const std::pair<const std::string, planning_interface::PlannerConfigurationSettings>& config : pconfig)
      algs.push_back(config.first);
  }

  void setPlannerConfigurations(const planning_interface::PlannerConfigurationMap& pconfig) override
  {
    // this call can add a few more configs than we pass in (adds defaults)
    ompl_interface_->setPlannerConfigurations(pconfig);
    // so we read the configs instead of just setting pconfig
    PlannerManager::setPlannerConfigurations(ompl_interface_->getPlannerConfigurations());
  }

  planning_interface::PlanningContextPtr
  getPlanningContext(const planning_scene::PlanningSceneConstPtr& planning_scene,
                     const planning_interface::MotionPlanRequest& req,
                     moveit_msgs::msg::MoveItErrorCodes& error_code) const override
  {
    return ompl_interface_->getPlanningContext(planning_scene, req, error_code);
  }
```

The most important function in the above code is the method “getPlanningContext”, which will return the context for the specific planner. The OMPL implemented the model based planning context, which is in “moveit2/moveit_planners/ompl/ompl_interface/src/model_based_planning_context.cpp”. I will spend time studying this implementation, but for now we can simply call the “solve” method implemented by the “ompl_interface::ModelBasedPlanningContext” to perform the planning. See below:

```
planning_interface::MotionPlanRequest req;
planning_interface::MotionPlanResponse res;
geometry_msgs::msg::PoseStamped pose;
pose.header.frame_id = "panda_link0";
pose.pose.position.x = 0.3;
pose.pose.position.y = 0.4;
pose.pose.position.z = 0.75;
pose.pose.orientation.w = 1.0;

std::vector<double> tolerance_pose(3, 0.01);
std::vector<double> tolerance_angle(3, 0.01);

moveit_msgs::msg::Constraints pose_goal =
    kinematic_constraints::constructGoalConstraints("panda_link8", pose, tolerance_pose, tolerance_angle);

req.group_name = PLANNING_GROUP;
req.goal_constraints.push_back(pose_goal);
planning_interface::PlanningContextPtr context =
    planner_instance->getPlanningContext(planning_scene, req, res.error_code_);
context->solve(res);
if (res.error_code_.val != res.error_code_.SUCCESS)
{
  RCLCPP_ERROR(LOGGER, "Could not compute plan successfully");
  return 0;
}
```

We can first construct a motion plan request with a pose goal, and then acquire the context by passing the request, then we can simply call the “solve” function to get the solution. Once we have the response, we can use RViz to visualize the solution trajectory. See below:

```
std::shared_ptr<rclcpp::Publisher<moveit_msgs::msg::DisplayTrajectory>> display_publisher =
    motion_planning_api_tutorial_node->create_publisher<moveit_msgs::msg::DisplayTrajectory>("/display_planned_path",
                                                                                             1);
moveit_msgs::msg::DisplayTrajectory display_trajectory;

/* Visualize the trajectory */
moveit_msgs::msg::MotionPlanResponse response;
res.getMessage(response);

display_trajectory.trajectory_start = response.trajectory_start;
display_trajectory.trajectory.push_back(response.trajectory);
visual_tools.publishTrajectoryLine(display_trajectory.trajectory.back(), joint_model_group);
visual_tools.trigger();
display_publisher->publish(display_trajectory);

/* Set the state in the planning scene to the final state of the last plan */
robot_state->setJointGroupPositions(joint_model_group, response.trajectory.joint_trajectory.points.back().positions);
planning_scene->setCurrentState(*robot_state.get());
```
